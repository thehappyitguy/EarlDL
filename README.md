# EarlDL
One-command, cross-platform wrapper around yt-dlp that always downloads

**EarlDL** is a simple, opinionated command-line tool that downloads:

- 🎥 Best available video (up to 4K if available)
- 🎵 Best available audio as MP3
- 📝 Video descriptions and subtitles
- 📁 Clean, human-readable folder structure

Built on top of `yt-dlp`, wrapped so you never have to remember flags again.
